# College Projects
College machine learning projects all using R in RStduio and done locally on a machine.  

# Classification Project
Used a university's admission data to create a logistic regression to classify whether an admitted student would or would not go to that university. In the R code you will see how I cleaned the data as well as how I approached creating a logistic regression model. Accompanying the code is a cursory report in an R-Markdown file to give a little more detail of the approach and results of the project.

# Unsuperivsed Learning Project
Utilized the same admissions data to perform Hierarchical Clustering and K-Means clustering to identify groups within the data. The R code shows how I approahced data cleaning for the clustering algorithms and how I approahced finding the optimal number of clusters through the elbow method or average silhouette method. With the code I have provided an R-Markdown report that goes a little more in detail of the insights and approaches I took for this project.

# Final Project
This project used the data from the House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques Competition to predict housing prices in Aimes, Iowa. The R code shows all the cleaning I performed and the models tested. Accompanying the code is a R-Markdown reporth that goes into more detial my thought process for cleaning the data and modeling the data.
